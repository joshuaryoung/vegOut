# vegOut

Hello!

This app was created using create-react-app.  It represents my progress after two weeks at DevMountain's immersive Web Development cohort in Salt Lake City, UT. This project required me to apply that I have learned in React, Node, HTML and CSS during my first two weeks learning to code. Although there may be bugs and there is certainly room for improvement, I used this project as an opportunity to practice and improve my skills as a web developer.

This app is intended to help vegans find recipes using the Edamam API, save their favorite recipes and find local vegan restaurants using the Yelp Fusion Business Search endpoint.  

Thanks for taking the time to track my progress!
